1. [Let's introduce ourselves](#introductions)
2. [The syllabus](#syllabus)
3. [Excel fun](#excel)

## <span id="introductions">1. Let's introduce ourselves</span>

Let's do introductions, since not everyone took Intro to Data Analytics or Python at the same time. 
To get us talking:
* Name (and pronouns, if you want to share them)
* If you're comfortable talking about it, please tell us about your project from the end of DAT-102 (or DAT-119/-129, if you think it's more applicable). 
* What kinds of things do you want to explore in Data Analytics 1?  
* Long-term, do you have a specific domain you're especially interested in? 

## <span id="syllabus">2. The syllabus</span>

Let's go over [it](../files/DAT-201_Course_Outline_2020_Spring.docx). Some things to discuss:
1. Are we happy on GitHub, or shall I open up our Blackboard shell?
2. Are we happy doing Darsow-style grading (self-assigned grades with possible instructor override), or would you like to earn points toward a numeric grade? I can live with either option.
3. We should go over the schedule, which is (as always!) flexible. We should talk about the Reading Day, but we don't have to make a decision now.
4. Reminder that we have [a Slack channel](https://ccac-data-analytics.slack.com) (#dat-201) for this course. You need to use your CCAC email address to register. 

## <span id="excel">3. Excel fun!</span>

Go download the other files in this directory (week01), if you haven't already. The Word doc has directions about what we're going to do with the Excel files. (Short version: we're going to have some fun with VLookup and pivot tables!)
