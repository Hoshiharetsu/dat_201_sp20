## <span id="introductions">1. Let's introduce ourselves</span>

Let's do introductions, since not everyone took Intro to Data Analytics or Python at the same time. 
To get us talking:
* Name (and pronouns, if you want to share them)
* If you're comfortable talking about it, please tell us about your project from the end of DAT-102 (or DAT-119/-129, if you think it's more applicable), or some data project Out In The World that you admire.
* What kinds of things do you want to explore in Data Analytics 1? Got any potential projects bubbling around in your head?  
* Long-term, do you have a specific domain you're especially interested in?

## <span id="syllabus">2. The syllabus</span>

Let's go over [it](../files/DAT-201_Course_Outline_2020_Spring.docx). Some things to discuss:
1. Are we happy on GitHub, or shall I open up our Blackboard shell? Either's OK with me. 
2. Are we happy doing Darsow-style grading (self-assigned grades with possible instructor override, [details here](https://technologyrediscovery.net/coursesGen/trgrading.html)), or would you like to earn points toward a numeric grade? I can live with either option.
    a. This might affect your answer (or not), so we should also be sure to talk about group work in this course before we make this decision.
3. We should go over the schedule, which is (as always!) flexible. We should talk about the Reading Day, but we don't have to make a decision now.
4. Reminder that we have [a Slack channel](https://ccac-data-analytics.slack.com) (#dat-201) for this course. You need to use your CCAC email address to register.
5. There are some career fairs and resume review activites coming up this semester. I've put information into [/files/announcements/](./files/announcements).

## <span id="excel">3. Excel fun!</span>

Go download the other files in this directory (week01), if you haven't already. The Word doc has directions about what we're going to do with the two LibreOffice Calc files, which will open just fine in Excel. (Short version: we're going to have some fun with VLookup and pivot tables!)

A note about Office vs. LibreOffice: you get Microsoft Office for free as a CCAC student, and there are benefits to knowing it, given how many businesses rely on it. That said, a lot of this course happens in a Linux environment, which means that taking the time to learn some LibreOffice could be a time-saver in the near future. Also, once you graduate, you only get MS Office if you (or your employers) pay for it; there might be some benefits to learning LibreOffice, in preparation for that eventuality.  

## <span id="homework">4. Homework for this week</span>

Obviously, **finish up your grade comparisons**. Come back next week ready to discuss what you've found out about different courses at CCAC and their grade distributions. (And what questions remain.)

You can upload your Excel files and a summary of your conclusions [here](https://acdccac-my.sharepoint.com/personal/edarsow_acd_ccac_edu/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?e=5%3A0721e98802b54c18b12d59ea6e9a9dc2&at=9&CT=1580172664342&OR=OWA%2DNT&CID=fac0b577%2D44b5%2D1d03%2D2c90%2D9cc34d7ca0ee&FolderCTID=0x0120003C700CE6FEE4A548B6EB8A40653D4910&id=%2Fpersonal%2Fedarsow%5Facd%5Fccac%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2Fdata%5Fanalytics%2Fdat%5F201%5F20sp%5Fstudent%5Fwork%2Fdata%5Fcleaning%2Fgrade%5Fcomparisons)

**Also, there are some readings to do between this week and next:** (We'll discuss at the start of class.)
