![What's that? You think I don't like the Peters map because I'm uncomfortable with having my cultural assumptions challenged?  Are you sure you're not ... ::puts on sunglasses:: ... projecting?](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/map_projections.png) *image &amp; alt text courtesy of XKCD*

### Some tools to help us understand ~~the joke above~~ projections
* [A tool showing map projection distortions](http://bl.ocks.org/syntagmatic/raw/ba569633d51ebec6ec6e/)
    * Acc. 40° 150% – The Acceptance index is a numerical measure that summarizes overall projection distortion, in this case with a maximum angular distortion of 40° and areal distortion of up to 150%.
    * Scale – The weighted mean error for overall scale distortion.
    * Areal – The weighted mean error for areal distortion.
    * Angular – The mean angular deformation index.
* [Comparing true sizes of various geographical and political boundaries](https://thetruesize.com/)
* [An image showing the distortions from various flat plotting methods](https://geoawesomeness.com/amazing-image-1921-will-explain-essence-map-projections/)
* [A map projection/distortion visualization](https://ncxiao.github.io/map-projections/index.html) - uses both [Tissot's indicatrix](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/product/mapping/tissots-indicatrix-helps-illustrate-map-projection-distortion/) and the Gedymin faces (from the link above)
* Bonus, if you're interested: [a 2001 article comparing tools for understanding map projections](https://link.gale.com/apps/doc/A78393275/AONE?u=pitt92539&sid=AONE&xid=58f394ec)

### Some questions I want you to answer:

If you're choosing between a cylindrical and a conical projection, which would maintain greater angular fidelity? Which would maintain greater distance fidelity to the spherical globe? Explain why.

Describe the ideal use cases for several types of projection system given the range of possible uses of a map. (Consider navigation, surveying, representations at various scales, etc.)
