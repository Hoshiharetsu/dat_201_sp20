## <span id="announcements">Announcements</span>

None that I can think of, so far.

## <span id="readings">Talking about homework</span>

Did everyone get through the exercise looking at the digital divide in PA? Who is willing to share your map with the class? What does the data tell you?  

I gave you two weeks for the readings, and I'll repeat them below, so we won't discuss them yet unless you've got questions.

## <span id="project">Talking about the project</span>

As promised, [here is the specification of the project](../files/map_mini_project_specification.md).

Let's go around the room to find out who has a topic that interests them, and let's see if we can get groups together using just that information. 

## <span id="qgis">QGIS Practice</span>
    
Note: we're doing all of this (at least, all that we are able) in class, together. I wrote it out in case that's easier for you, or you want to remind yourself how to do some of this later.

You're going to want to open GitHub on the browser _on the machine where you're running QGIS_. (Are you running it on the VM? Open it in Firefox on the VM.)

## Practice with QGIS on your own:

Look through the [PASDA](http://www.pasda.psu.edu/) data sets, and make a map and a data-based assertion that's interesting to you. (If you want to use [WPRDC](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset) instead, you can.) If none of the data sets speak to you, please look at how many [oil and gas](http://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=283) or [coal](http://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=271) operations are being run in the [Chesapeake Bay watershed](http://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=59) (or Allegheny County or any other subset of the state of interest to you). There are also [oil and gas water pollution control facilities](http://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=284), if you'd like to look at those. Don't forget to cite your data sources, and keep a log of the changes you make, so that another data analyst could follow your steps. 

Try making an attractive layout of your PASDA-data-based map that tells the story you intend to tell. 

Put your map, log, and layout into a folder (please put your first name and NOT your last name somewhere in the name of the folder), and upload it to [our shared directory](https://acdccac-my.sharepoint.com/personal/edarsow_acd_ccac_edu/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?originalPath=aHR0cHM6Ly9hY2RjY2FjLW15LnNoYXJlcG9pbnQuY29tLzpmOi9nL3BlcnNvbmFsL2VkYXJzb3dfYWNkX2NjYWNfZWR1L0VrUzQzNF9LMVV4RnZjbDBQNEI5WjAwQnMwV2dkRjF1MDZpQTdKZFJxbEtXR2c%5FcnRpbWU9eko3alpIQ3gxMGc&viewid=e2ddbbdb%2D20ac%2D4c4b%2D9dff%2Db8735d690d4b&id=%2Fpersonal%2Fedarsow%5Facd%5Fccac%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2Fdata%5Fanalytics%2Fdat%5F201%5F20sp%5Fstudent%5Fwork), inside the folder "maps!" -> "practice_maps."

### Readings (OK, I did add one, but it's fun) - we'll discuss next week

* [What's in a map?](https://www.gislounge.com/whats-in-a-map/)
* [Design principles for cartography](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/product/mapping/design-principles-for-cartography/)
* [The Incline - Pittsburgh Maps Edition](https://theincline.com/newsletter/2020-02-13-the-pittsburgh-maps-edition/)
