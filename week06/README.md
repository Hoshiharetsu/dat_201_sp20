## <span id="announcements">Announcements</span>

Reminder that there's a DAT curriculum planning meeting this Thursday, and we're doing a massive rewrite of the program's learning outcomes. If you've got things you want to see in our curriculum&mdash;things we've done well and need to keep doing, things you want to learn but haven't learned so far and don't see listed in our courses, things you think we should have skipped or emphasized less&mdash;get your comments in! You can email me, [call Eric Darsow](https://technologyrediscovery.net/#contact), talk to either of us before class/during class work time, fill in the [anonymous survey](https://forms.gle/8byp3BTu2ex127Xk8), or show up at 4pm on Thursday to make your opinions known!

## <span id="guest">Draw the Lines PA</span>

Dan Davis from Draw the Lines PA is here this evening!

## <span id="readings">Talking about homework</span>

Show off our PASDA maps! (Hopefully the shared directory worked OK.)

Talk about any issues we ran into.

## <span id="project">Project check-in time</span>

I want to give you at least a few minutes before the end of the class to check in with your project groups. Make sure you know how to contact one another, and you have a plan for communication between classes; get each other's emails or phone numbers, at least. 
    * If you want a channel in the Data Analytics Slack, I'm happy to create one for you. (You might have permissions enough to make these yourselves. My requested format, please: #20SP_201_groupname)
    * If you want me to make you a group in our course Blackboard shell, I'm happy to do that, too.

The groups (feel free to come up with good group names, and I'll update them here):

* Potholes - most complaints, assumptions about road quality, "is this a good way of distributing roadwork money?"
    * Zach
    * Natalee
    * Kayla
* Supermarket density - comparison to public transit locations, looking for deserts
    * Drew
    * Casey
    * Jinrong
    * Dan
* Air quality - PASDA emission data
    * Eric
    * Jason
    * Brandyn
    * Mike

## <span id="homework">Homework for next week</span>

Make progress on the project. 

Next week's agenda: we'll check in as a class; I'll make any announcements that might have popped up; you'll get to fill in SOSOs and grade cards; and then the bulk of class time will be set aside for you to work together. 

Project presentations are happening the following week. (I'll give you 30 minutes at the beginning of class to sort out any last-minute issues with your presentations.)
