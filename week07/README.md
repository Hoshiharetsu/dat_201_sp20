## <span id="announcements">Announcements</span>

[Updated attendance policy](../attendance_policy.md)

Surveys of Student Opinion (SOSOs) - Not to be confused with [the optional anonymous survey I have posted](https://forms.gle/8byp3BTu2ex127Xk8), which I can see immediately. (These surveys serve overlapping, but different, purposes: SOSOs are for me to make course corrections _between_ semesters and for you to tell my bosses what you think of me. My little optional survey is so you can tell me what to change and what to keep the same _this semester_, while you're still in my class.) 

Rubric for grade cards is posted [here](../files/grade_card_rubric.md).

## <span id="project">Project work time</span>

Most of this class period is set aside for you to work together in groups on your midterm project and presentation. I'm here to help! 

## <span id="homework">Homework for next week</span>

I think a group project presentation is sufficient homework.
