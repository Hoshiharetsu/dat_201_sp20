Rubric for grade cards

Surveys of Student Opinion (SOSOs) - Not to be confused with [the optional anonymous survey I have posted](https://forms.gle/8byp3BTu2ex127Xk8), which I can see immediately. (These surveys serve overlapping, but different, purposes: SOSOs are for me to make course corrections _between_ semesters and for you to tell my bosses what you think of me. My little optional survey is so you can tell me what to change and what to keep the same _this semester_, while you're still in my class.) 

## <span id="project">Project check-in time</span>

30 minutes to get all loose ends tied up with your groups. Please let me know when you're ready, in case it takes less time than that, and we can start early. 

## <span id="midterm">Project presentations</span>

Here are the components your presentation absolutely needs to have:

   * Five minutes or more of content. Try not to go over 10 minutes.
   * The question you set out to answer.
   * A fully-baked map layout.
   * A high-level description of the steps you took.
   * A data-backed claim (or a set of claims) that address your question. Maybe they don't answer it fully, and that's OK, but ...
   * ... if there is more question left after your analysis, tell us what else needs to be done. (This could turn into a project for future students, or could be something you come back to as part of your capstone project.)
