## <span id="announcements">Announcements</span>

None yet.

## <span id="project">Project check-in time</span>

30 minutes to get all loose ends tied up with your groups. Please let me know when you're ready, in case it takes less time than that, and we can start early. 

## <span id="midterm">Project presentations</span>

Here are the components your presentation absolutely needs to have:

   * Five minutes or more of content. Try not to go over 10 minutes.
   * The question you set out to answer.
   * A fully-baked map layout.
   * A high-level description of the steps you took.
   * A data-backed claim (or a set of claims) that address your question. Maybe they don't answer it fully, and that's OK, but ...
   * ... if there is more question left after your analysis, tell us what else needs to be done. (This could turn into a project for future students, or could be something you come back to as part of your capstone project.)

**Do not forget to upload your files to the shared server (or GitHub, I'm not picky).** I'll break my "I don't grade anything emailed to me" rule this one time, to accept links to people's GitHub repositories. (I'm not grading you, but I'll give you feedback. I don't promise it'll be _fast,_ but you'll get it in time to act on it before the final project.)

1. Watch these three videos about OpenRefine (which used to be called Google Refine):

2. [Install OpenRefine](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Installation-Instructions) -- if you want to put it on a laptop to bring to class, that's fine. If you want to [install it on your Linux VM](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Installation-Instructions#linux), that's also fine.
