## <span id="announcements">Announcements</span>

First, let's check in. How are people doing? Can we move forward with presentations (which are allowed to be pre-recorded videos) tonight, or are we missing a lot of people? I was *not* planning to record this part of our Zoom session.  

Do we need to talk about CCAC's, Pittsburgh's, Allegheny County's, or Pennsylvania's current timeline, before we talk about this class specifically?

If you need help during the next few weeks, or you're looking for how to help others, [this Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oL6ju8kEQd_cWltkufZvVq1tMGetsY92ZVDzlwPa35I/edit?usp=sharing) is full of resources.

Survey responses were not plentiful, but the ones that came in were all over the place, with several people wanting to learn *extra* things beyond what I had on the syllabus and several saying "um, we could be done now; that'd be fine with me." 

Let's check in about goals for the rest of the semester:
* I'm leaning against requiring a final project, but let's discuss. 
* I have a battle-tested GitHub lesson ready for you if you want it; soon it'll be two. (Part 1 was done in-person, though.) 
* I'd *really* like to teach you OpenRefine, but could be talked out of both that and GitHub if a third week of databases is a much higher priority for you. (We plan to have a dedicated databases class in Spring 2021.)
* We can talk about synchronous vs. asynchronous.

## <span id="project">Project check-in time</span>

I think I can put you into breakout rooms with your groups, if you need time to chat amongst yourselves. (This is untested-by-me technology, so. We'll do our best.) 

## <span id="midterm">Project presentations</span>

Here are the components your presentation should  have:

   * The question you set out to answer.
   * A fully-baked map layout.
   * A high-level description of the steps you took.
   * A data-backed claim (or a set of claims) that address your question. Maybe they don't answer it fully, and that's OK, but ...
   * ... if there is more question left after your analysis, tell us what else needs to be done. (This could turn into a project for future students, or could be something you come back to as part of your capstone project.)

**Do not forget to upload your files to the shared server (or GitHub, I'm not picky). That includes a list of what each group member contributed.
** I'll break my "I don't grade anything emailed to me" rule this one time, to accept links to people's GitHub repositories. (I'm not grading you, but I'll give you feedback. I don't promise it'll be _fast,_ but you'll get it.)

## <span id="github">GitHub? Do we want to try this tonight?</span>

[Here are the somewhat unfinished directions](./github.md)

## <span id="homework">Homework for next week</span>

1. Make sure you have a GitHub account and can log in.
1. Watch these three videos about OpenRefine (which used to be called Google Refine):
	* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNccGtn3Wb0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNccGtn3Wb0)
	* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO8NVCs_Ba0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO8NVCs_Ba0)
	* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tsyz3ibYzk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tsyz3ibYzk)
1. [Install OpenRefine](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Installation-Instructions) -- you can install it on your own machine or [on your Linux VM](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Installation-Instructions#linux), whichever you like better. I'll be demoing it in Windows if we're trying to meet synchronously, or if you want it in Linux, I'll make a video ahead of time.
