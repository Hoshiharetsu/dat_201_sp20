## <span id="announcements">Announcements</span>

Trying to work synchronously last week was ... not great. I'm going to pull back on my plan to do class entirely synchronously, with recordings (which take hours to render, by the way). I'll still log into our Zoom room at 6pm every Monday night, to give everyone a chance to check in, connect with one another as humans, ask each other questions, etc. But if I don't have synchronous things to go over, I'll set you free to work through the asynchronous stuff on your own, with your classmates and me (and, I've heard a rumor: possibly also Professor Darsow) available to help over [Slack](https://ccac-data-analytics.slack.com). 

Remember that there is a Slack desktop app available so you don't have to dedicate a browser tab to our Slack to use it. There's also a phone app.

What did you think of the videos? This is a tool we want to learn, right?
