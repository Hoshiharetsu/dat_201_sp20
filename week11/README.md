## <span id="announcements">Announcements</span>

I'm going to log into Zoom at 6pm on Monday. If nobody joins me I'll log back out at 6:30. If you want to pop in and chat or ask questions, please do! 

## <span id="github">GitHub </span>

OK! Our GitHub videos are up! Along with the directions! They have their own home:

I am not perfect. Whenever someone finds an error somewhere, I hope they will tell me. (If you want to be very fancy and post it as an "issue" in GitHub, rock on! But I'll accept corrections by email, Slack, or Discord, too. If you want to be _extremely_ fancy and do a pull request, I'm going to be super impressed.)

## <span id="homework">Homework</span>

Go through the GitHub videos (if you want to skip the first one you can; if you don't want to watch the videos and just want to follow the written directions, you can), and **when you get to the part where it says "email me," do that!** Let me know when you want to take your turn at editing the datasets repo. I will let you know when it's ready for you to edit, and then you can put in your pull request, and I'll accept it! 

If you didn't watch the OpenRefine videos for last week, this is your chance. I'll post videos and large amounts of text about OpenRefine and the start of databases next week!
