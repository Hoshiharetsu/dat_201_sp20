## <span id="announcements">Announcements</span>

I'm going to log into Zoom at 6pm on Monday. If nobody joins me I'll log back out at 6:30. If you want to pop in and chat or ask questions or get a tour of what I think we're doing this week, please do! 

I've put a list of conferences that are potentially interesting to us (I'm planning to "attend" them all, at least in part) in their own section, below.

## <span id="github">GitHub </span>

OK! Our GitHub videos are (still) up! Along with the directions! They have their own home:
https://github.com/ccac-data-analytics/learn_github 

Reminder: Email me _before_ making the Pull Request, and wait until I clear you to go next. This is not how it would be done on a real project&mdash;you would each probably have one or more branches you were working on, in different areas of the code base, and you'd make pull requests whenever you're ready. We're taking turns because doing them one-by-one decreases the chances of a merge conflict or other weird behavior by Git; it's more important in this case because most of what people are doing is editing one of 3-4 README files, which drastically increases the chances of conflicts, as compared to something on a bigger scale.

## <span id="postgres">PostgreSQL

Those videos and directions are [in Blackboard](https://courses.ccac.edu/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_6801485_1&course_id=_48720_1). For reasons. 

## <span id="refine">Open Refine</span>

Those videos and directions are going here: https://github.com/ccac-data-analytics/openrefine_lesson (This is not very interesting yet. It will get interesting soon. I'll remove this note when it gets interesting.)

## <span id="conferences">Online conferences that might interest you</span>

* This one, being held this weekend (4/25), is about Information Security, not Data Analytics, but I'd argue they are intersecting fields. It's exciting because it's expressly designed for beginners. (I know one of the speakers, and she's excellent.) 
	* [Session descriptions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bfJFemJpy5W69YZze5NgbKf2E37NqXburzCj4P6Ahiw/edit?usp=sharing)
	* [Registration information in this tweet](https://twitter.com/IntroSecCon/status/1251723877228572673?s=20)
* [PyCon](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMjMBMGt0WJQLeluw6qNJuA) - Would have been in Pittsburgh this year. Last week, actually. Many of the planned talks will end up on the YouTube channel (which is what I linked, above, instead of [the conference website](https://us.pycon.org/2020/). Also, I'm (virtually) attending the Education Summit and the Trainers' Summit on the 4/23 and 4/24.
* [CSVconf](https://csvconf.com/) - May 13-14 online. I'm also planning to attend
