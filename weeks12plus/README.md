## <span id="announcements">Announcements</span>

4/27 is our last official meeting date, and I'll be online from 6pm until people stop having questions or 6:30pm, whichever comes later. (So if you have questions, please show up _before_ 6:30, or else you'll need to send them over Slack/Discord/email.) 

I'm still planning to pop into Zoom on 5/4, even though it is officially a Reading Day, and I invite you to stop in and ask questions about databases, OpenRefine, other data stuff, birds, coffee, Animal Crossing, or ... literally anything, I'm there to chat if you need someone to chat with. If nobody shows up by 6:30pm, I'll log back off, no stress. 

There is nothing specific for you to do on 5/11. After this week (and the OpenRefine module going up in the early part of the week), you're done for the semester for DAT-201.

And I'll hopefully see you all in DAT-202 (which will be somewhat more rigorous than the second half of 201 has been, even if we are all still online-only). 

## <span id="github">GitHub </span>

OK! Our GitHub videos are (still) up! Along with the directions! They have their own home:
https://github.com/ccac-data-analytics/learn_github 

~Reminder: Email me _before_ making the Pull Request, and wait until I clear you to go next. This is not how it would be done on a real project&mdash;you would each probably have one or more branches you were working on, in different areas of the code base, and you'd make pull requests whenever you're ready. We're taking turns because doing them one-by-one decreases the chances of a merge conflict or other weird behavior by Git; it's more important in this case because most of what people are doing is editing one of 3-4 README files, which drastically increases the chances of conflicts, as compared to something on a bigger scale.~

You are now free to make pull requests at your leisure. It's going slowly enough that I can manage it. Please help me make sense of previous semesters' projects for future students! 

## <span id="postgres">PostgreSQL

Those videos and directions are [in Blackboard](https://courses.ccac.edu/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_6801485_1&course_id=_48720_1). For reasons. 

## <span id="refine">Open Refine</span>

Those videos and directions are going here: https://github.com/ccac-data-analytics/openrefine_lesson (This is not very interesting yet. It will get interesting soon. I'll remove this note when it gets interesting.)

## <span id="conferences">Online conferences that might interest you</span>

* [PyCon](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMjMBMGt0WJQLeluw6qNJuA) - Would have been in Pittsburgh this year. Last week, actually. Many of the planned talks will end up on the YouTube channel (which is what I linked, above, instead of [the conference website](https://us.pycon.org/2020/). 
* [CSVconf](https://csvconf.com/) - May 13-14 online. I'm also planning to attend

### Past conferences

* This one, being held this weekend (4/25), is about Information Security, not Data Analytics, but I'd argue they are intersecting fields. It's exciting because it's expressly designed for beginners. (I know one of the speakers, and she's excellent.) - It's going on YouTube! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx1Ektc73drCDq6W0tclZ8g
